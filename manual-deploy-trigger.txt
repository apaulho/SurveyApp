This file change should trigger Netlify to rebuild.

Expected in next deploy:
- Edit buttons with red borders in survey modals
- Green "New Question" buttons  
- Console logging for debugging
- Question count displays
- Full editing functionality

If this doesn't work, Netlify webhook may need manual trigger.
